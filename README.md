# Analyzing-TV-Data
In this project we will look at Super Bowl Data, generating insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows. We will develop an informative plot that helps to visualize the viewership and quality of The Office throughout its nine seasons.

 1. TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game
    Load the CSV data into DataFrames
    Display the first five rows of each DataFrame
 2. Taking note of dataset issues
    Display and inspect the summaries of the TV and halftime musician DataFrames for issues.
 3. Combined points distribution.
    Plot a histogram of combined points then display the rows with the most extreme combined point outcomes.
 4. Point difference distribution.
    Modify and display the histogram of point differences, then display the rows with the most extreme 
    point difference outcomes.
    Select the Super Bowl(s) where the point difference was equal to 1.
    Select the Super Bowl(s) where the point difference was greater than or equal to 35.
 5. Do blowouts translate to lost viewers?
    Plot household share vs. point difference.
 6. Viewership and the ad industry over time.
    Create three line plots using the tv DataFrame to compare viewers, rating, and ad cost.
 7. Halftime shows weren't always this great.
    Filter and display the musicians for halftime shows up to and including Super Bowl XXVII.
 8. Who has the most halftime show appearances?
    Select and display the musicians with more than one halftime show appearance.
 9. Who performed the most songs in a halftime show?
    Modify the histogram of number of songs performed for non-band musicians.
 10. Conclusion.
     Who will win Super Bowl LIII?
